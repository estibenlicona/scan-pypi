    "When running `python -m src.interface.cli --xlsx`, the analysis encounters missing packages in the temporary pipgrip resolution environment.\n"

    "## The Error Message Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The error occurs in three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. SyntaxWarning: Invalid Escape Sequence\n",
    "```\n",
    "SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\s'\n",
    "  for sub_exp in re.split(\"\\\\s*(?:and|or)\\\\s*\", cond_text):\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is a minor warning from pipgrip's internal pip resolver. It's harmless but indicates outdated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. UserWarning: Deprecated pkg_resources\n",
    "```\n",
    "UserWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API\n",
    "The pkg_resources package is slated for removal as early as 2025-11-30.\n",
    "```\n",
    "This warns that `pkg_resources` (from setuptools) is deprecated. Pin setuptools to <81 if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Critical Error: Missing Packages\n",
    "```\n",
    "Required packages missing: ipykernel, comm, debugpy, ipython, ...\n",
    "Please run `pip install -r C:\\...\\requirements.txt`\n",
    "If the issue persists try again with --skip-unresolved.\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is the main problem: pipgrip's temporary environment lacks dependencies needed for resolution.\n"

    "## Root Cause Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "When pipgrip resolves dependencies, it:\n",
    "1. Creates a temporary isolated environment\n",
    "2. Tries to install and inspect packages in that environment\n",
    "3. Recursively resolves their dependencies\n",
    "4. Returns the complete dependency tree as JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "The error occurs because **some packages cannot be fully resolved in the isolated environment** due to:\n",
    "- Missing system dependencies\n",
    "- Platform-specific requirements\n",
    "- C extensions that need compilation\n",
    "- Environment markers that don't match\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Happens\n",
    "- `ipykernel`, `jupyter-client`, etc. are dev/optional dependencies of some packages\n",
    "- They may not be installable in the temporary resolution environment\n",
    "- Pipgrip **fails hard** by default when it encounters unresolvable packages\n"

    "## The Solution: `--skip-unresolved` Flag\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Changed\n",
    "**File:** `src/infrastructure/adapters/dependency_resolver_adapter.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cmd = [\"pipgrip\", \"--tree-json-exact\", package]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cmd = [\"pipgrip\", \"--tree-json-exact\", \"--skip-unresolved\", package]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What `--skip-unresolved` Does\n",
    "- **Tells pipgrip to continue** even when some packages cannot be resolved\n",
    "- **Returns partial results** instead of failing completely\n",
    "- **Includes resolved dependencies** and skips the ones that couldn't be installed\n",
    "- **Allows analysis to proceed** with \"best effort\" dependency information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "1. Most packages CAN be resolved (numpy, requests, etc.)\n",
    "2. Only optional/dev packages in isolated env fail (jupyter, ipython, etc.)\n",
    "3. We only need the dependency tree, not a working installation\n",
    "4. Partial dependency information is better than complete failure\n"

    "## Testing the Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Behavior After Fix\n",
    "1. ✅ Analysis **does not fail** on missing packages\n",
    "2. ✅ Pipgrip returns **partial dependency tree** (resolved + skipped)\n",
    "3. ✅ Snyk analysis **completes** and generates xlsx report\n",
    "4. ✅ xlsx contains **all resolvable packages and their dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Verify\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run the analysis with the fixed code\n",
    "cd e:\\Repos\\pypi\n",
    "python -m src.interface.cli --xlsx\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check output:\n",
    "# - Should generate consolidated_report.xlsx\n",
    "# - Should include Dependencias Directas and Dependencias Transitivas\n",
    "# - NO timeout or \"Required packages missing\" error\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Expect in xlsx\n",
    "- **Packages column:** All packages found (both production and dev)\n",
    "- **Dependencias Directas:** Production dependencies (from PEP 508)\n",
    "- **Dependencias Transitivas:** Development/optional dependencies\n",
    "- **Some packages may show empty dependencies** if they were skipped by pipgrip\n"

    "## Alternative Solutions (Not Implemented)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Install Missing Packages (Not Recommended)\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install ipykernel comm debugpy ipython decorator ipython-pygments-lexers ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Problem:** \n",
    "- This would pollute the main environment\n",
    "- Jupyter packages not needed for dependency analysis\n",
    "- Could conflict with existing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Use Different Resolver (pip instead of pipgrip)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cmd = [\"pip\", \"download\", \"--dry-run\", package]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "- pip doesn't support `--tree-json-exact` output format\n",
    "- Would need custom JSON parsing\n",
    "- Slower than pipgrip\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3: Pre-resolve in Clean Virtual Environment (Complex)\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv /tmp/resolve_env\n",
    "source /tmp/resolve_env/bin/activate\n",
    "pip install package\n",
    "pip show --json package\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "- Much slower (create venv for each package)\n",
    "- Resource intensive\n",
    "- Added complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why `--skip-unresolved` is Best\n",
    "✅ Minimal change (single flag)\n",
    "✅ Fast (no venv creation)\n",
    "✅ Reliable (pipgrip design intended for this)\n",
    "✅ Acceptable trade-off (partial info > no info)\n"
